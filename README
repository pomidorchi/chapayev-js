"Chapayev game" (Russian: игра в Чапаева) is a game played on a checkerboard, a
hybrid of checkers and billiards.

Game rules and funny details are present on Wikipedia:

The project has been started as a programming exercise while studying Javascript
and different JS libraries. In the same time I just wanted to play Chapayev
with friends, so I decided to implement multiplayer version as well.

JS libraries used so far:

* Raphaёl -- for game graphics and animation
* Knockout.js -- for structuring the code, automatically updating view based on
  model using MVVM pattern
* Socket.io -- for client/server interaction suitable for any browser
* Node.js -- for server implementation
* jQuery -- for querying the DOM, providing templates for Knockout.
* Sylvester -- for vector/matrix operation needed for collision resolving.
